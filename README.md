The Hakki Pikkis

Unlike most scheduled tribes, the semi-nomadic Hakki Pikkis (bird catchers) have travelled outside the country in search of fortune. Many have settled in African countries like Sudan and become herbal healers.

This exposure has helped them thrive and tap into their innate entrepreneurial spirit.

“The Hakki Pikki is distinct from other tribal communities. Unlike others who may be more reserved, the Hakki Pikkis are not shy and quickly adapt to modernity, largely due to their nomadic nature. They are not confined to one place and have a natural inclination to explore,” said Sreekanth. The Hakki Pikki migrated to Karnataka from parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan at least a hundred years ago. After bird catching and hunting were outlawed under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, they turned to marketing traditional medicine.
